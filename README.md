# LLMs-Agent
**The first but also long-lasting homework - using large language models (LLMs) to build a command line tool helper **
o DDL: two week before the last course
o Local LLMs (LLaMA 2) or remote (ChatGPT or tiL â€”#), you chose o Add if-else if needed
o Chinese support is cool and useful!
o Test with a clean environment (VM, docker) so it won't mess up your computers

**Submission: code + detailed documents + testing results ** 
o The best ones will be demonstrated in the last course 
o Don't copy from other projects!
